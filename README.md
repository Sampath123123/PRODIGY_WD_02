A stopwatch web page is a simple, user-friendly tool that allows users to start, pause, and reset a timer. It typically displays the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, with intuitive buttons for control. The design can be minimalistic or themed, with the stopwatch positioned centrally on the page for easy access.
